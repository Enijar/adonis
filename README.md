# Adonis

Website for Adonis London.

### Software Requirements

- Node.js 14.3.0
- NPM 7.5.2

### Architecture

All UI code lives inside the `client` directory and all server code lives inside the `server` directory. These two projects have their own separate dependencies.

Both the UI and server projects use TypeScript.

The UI project used React and Styled Components to render UI elements to the screen.

### Getting Started

```shell
npm install
npm start
```
